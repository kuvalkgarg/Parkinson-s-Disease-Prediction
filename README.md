# Parkinson's Disease Prediction
This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques, in this case, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It analyzes various vocal features extracted from speech recordings to classify whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not. The dataset used in this project is the "parkinsons.csv" dataset, which contains voice measurements of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.
